### what does it mean to create today, in the digital world?

There's something beautiful about blending together ideas across different domains to build something entirely new. In art, the concept of uniqueness—how a work belongs to the mind(s) that created it—makes you wonder about how special is each action, each transformation. All of a person's consciousness and subconsciousness emerge together into something experiential, and not only for others but for themselves. I've lived this myself. When listening to, reading, or watching something I created some time ago, it feels like someone else is speaking to me. I've become the spectator of the things I've built for myself.

If something can so profoundly reach you as the creator, imagine what it might mean for another soul—it could be life-changing. When you understand what your creation means to you, how art can affect another person, and the impact of building something new, you begin to grasp the true outcomes of creation. You meet yourself. You engage with life. And that's when you realize: understanding what this means to you allows you to translate it into the universal human experience. 

We are all unique, yet we share more than we realize in our everyday lives. Some messages transcend language entirely, while others speak through multiple ones. Some resonate universally—they simply feel right. These universal truths are shared and experienced by everyone. Are human. 

Both science and art teach us that everything follows similar patterns—we just need to ask the right questions to see them. Start with the fundamentals, understand the principles of the world you're building, find the underlying structures, and build from there.

now that you know how to speak to yourselve, you’re deay to make that for another person. and as in art, bussines is about this transformation of the human experience

the act of creating is universal, in . my opinion. no quiero decir que este es el sentimiento universal a nivel creadores, sino que ese tema es más para el qué decimos con nuestras creaciones.

## what does it mean to create today, in the digital world?

why do we use tech, what is that for us.
where it’s the science!? It’s in the way of being. it’s in the drive for exploring. we are all exploring. in so many different ways, but we are. on each step. forcing the boundaries of what���s now, and what’s then (future). and that’s scary. we always hear that, and we’ve always knew that. 

I also believe in the expression through the digital world. I’ve always seen the internet as a place to built and create things. And I admire the people who share their ideas into the world. So this goes out. This is how I’m navigating the world these days, and this is a way of existing that I hope never stops. —— if you don’t transmit and transform —- it get’s lost in the void.

In esscence, a business or any creative “act” is the act of finding meaning and transform through ideas. Self expressino into a group of people, and into the world.

## HOW TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD. El juego del futuro.
WE FIND THE CREATIVE POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE TECHNICAL (ia y tech)

### I need something that’s right here and right now. Transforming.

WE HAVE THE TOOLS

you see a lot of things happening and you know the maths and the physics you’re studying, in my case, has a lot of power to move things. Maybe you feel the same way about the things you’ve studied. They can change things, if you’d like to. So there’s a tradeoff and a balance to make between the timelines in which you want to act in.

I still think that a better infrastructure for science and industry can multiply those two timelines and make one to go better in hand with the other.  [MADNESS DOC]

THAT’S one reason why ml is so interesting, it’s pushing boundaries in so many areas. WHy? I thinnk because it’s about cognition amplification for us. Do everything but better and faster.

So a big part of the way business are built is through transmiting ideas and mind motions. Movements. Feelings. Is the same as music. They act in the field of emotions. And that’s what marketing and design are assessing, providing that conversation despite the whole machinery around things. And for me, one can’t deny that creating something to execute an idea and change reality has some art to it (yes we can define it in multple form).

### Science and art are long term. Business can have an impact now.

 see it more in the processes mainly. In an effort for bridging the scientific and industrial communuties here in Chile, we’ve been building this company agency for another scientific creators (and tech industries) with my friends Wale and Macka, and although we need to define the metrics for growth and hypotesis testing to iterate on what we do, most of the time we find asking ourselves why are we doing what we trying to do, and what are we trying to do for other people or for our past selves. Is building on top of what was there before.

And I think it doesn’t have to be always about the medium of expression. For instance, i hated coding a couple years ago and code is the main activity of this year for me and I’m loving it. Possibly by two things, the experience of creating things with AI (link to EL EDIFICIO) and the personal discover of software development. I feel like a kid creating with legos.

Ml es la puerta hacia la ciencia. Porque los papers ocurren en empresas. And it will provide next generation science (neurofis), and it actually is transforming industries.

There’s is also truth that code is the number 1 leverage tool of this century. Everything is systematized by lines of comands to, interestingly enough, open and close gates of electric currnt (potential) or other physical properties of materials. CITE TO NAVAL.

### What to do now. Do business around everything.

and this is the stage of my human esperience where i’m starting to see how the fundamentals that humanity has discovered mainfest in this giant network, and starting to see how the woorld swe created, aside from the 2natural”, is connected.

## Chapter 3: THE THREE PRINCIPLES TOWARDS BUSINESS + SCI + TECH

here are some reminders I've written for myself to maintain clarity after I started working and creating in tech

### Structure.
Always improve your understanding on how things work in general in the context of technology. The basics of software, how computers work, how is everything connected both through online platforms and underneath them.

But more importantly, have in mind that everything is shaped by business: interests and exchanges.

Is the general knowledge that helps you to understand what is going on independently of the medium. Basic sciences HAS HELPED ME with this. But I can imagine (you) that each person has its own framework to understand the world and human relationships. And that’s a basis for the next steps.

### Build.
Keep improving on your ability to build things. Become better at you're programming language, explore others form of coding. I've transitioned from data analysis to development, and the combination 10 times more powerful.

Keep learning about what it takes for a product or service to be built. How teams are composed, what are the different roles. How they communicate and how all parts work together.

The idea is to understand how people organize to create tools for other people.

### Communicate.

There are a lot of moving pieces and it's easy to feel lost when you're starting. Maybe it's always like that. But remember that everything is about communication. Independently of the specific part you are positioned, the world works with exchange of ideas.There is always a message someone wants to transmit.So make sure to be reflective on your own ideas, and connect everything you learn so you can express them.
